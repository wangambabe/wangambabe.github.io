            <p class="text-grey"><small>On today’s episode we take a different approach and we find out how our listeners are feeling.
            With social media being a buzz and everyone sharing their achievements it’s easy to compare yourself to others. 
            It is also easy for you to feel as though u don’t belong in certain positions.
              So today’s show our listeners share how feeling like an imposter has influenced their abilities to either go for
              the opportunity or not because they had feelings of anxiety & feelings of not belonging in certain spaces.
              Have you ever felt this way? Tag us on social media & drop us a comment we’d love to hear your views</small></p><br>
